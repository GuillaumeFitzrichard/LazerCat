# Confuse-A-Cat Interactive Lazer
> Arduino Nano based project to automate and engage cats in lazer play!
Very much a work in progress, but progressing it is!

## Components
- 1x Arduino nano
- 2x MS18 servo
- 1x HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- 1x laser

## How It Works
> A laser is moved about X and Y planes with servos at varying speeds, pauses and blinking.  If the ultrasonic sensor above the laser detects cats or objects within a set distance, "spaz mode" is initiated and makes the laser move much more quickly and without pause.

## Planned Improvements
- Add a joystick and manual control mode
- Improve logic of laser placement
- Web app control
